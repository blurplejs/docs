blurple.js is a Discord bot framework and runtime based on the popular Discord.js API client.

::: warning
blurple.js is still being specified. The documentation will remain the most up-to-date source of information about blurple during this phase,
but it is not yet developed or even remotely usable.

## Components
#### Runtime
The runtime is available for anyone who wants to use already built bots with as little configuration or programming as necessary. One main concern of the runtime is parallelism, meaning that it's made for running multiple bots on potentially multiple servers simultaneously.

This is also the component you will need if you just want to get started with writing a new bot.

#### Extensions
Used by anyone who wants to write their own bot and distribute it.
