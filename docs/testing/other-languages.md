# Other Languages

::: tip
This library is written entirely in TypeScript, so if you're using node.js as your runtime you're good to go already.
:::

The primary focus currently lies on integrating the entire Gateway feature set first, before we can start looking at bindings for other languages. We are however already considering support for these languages in the future:
- Python
- Rust
- JavaScript

Feel free to suggest (or contribute) support for other languages too.
